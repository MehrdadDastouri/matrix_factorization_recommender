# Recommender System with Matrix Factorization

This project demonstrates how to build a simple recommender system using matrix factorization. The model learns latent factors for users and items to predict missing ratings in a user-item rating matrix.

## Features
- Generates a synthetic user-item rating matrix.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Implements a matrix factorization model using PyTorch.
- Evaluates the model on test data and visualizes the predicted ratings.
